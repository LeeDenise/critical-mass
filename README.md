## Work / Project Examples
 
### Logistics Auth Service
 
Our previous client had an issue with connecting the data from multiple databases, our team had to build the client application, resource server to host the protected user accounts, and authorization server to verify the identity of the user and issue the access tokens.
 
I started to help senior developers for researching Kafka and Spark to check if the distributed architecture can help to optimize the data processing for the client application. A requirement of an application was to have the best and latest security by the client which is why the team and I  set up the latest OAuth and Spring Security. On top of all that  I developed the RESTful API that serves data personalized to our client’s request.
 
### Version 2 of the old project.
 
A few years ago, when I learned to program for the first time, I built a clinic appointment web application. To meet a physiotherapist, I always had to call the reception to make an appointment. So I was inspired that it would be nice to have digitalized system for the process.
 
The first version of the project had many issues. The sign-up and sign-in authentication library that I used was deprecated. At that time, I deployed to Heroku's free server so that the program was too slow to load content on the first load. There were some design changes in regards to being responsive to all devices.

I implemented spring security to build a secure sign-up and sign-in system and deployed the system to AWS. The design got a complete re-haul to have a more responsive design.  Lastly, I thought it would be more helpful if the admin and user roles is divided. So I added the admin dashboard page and created new roles for the authentication: USER and ADMIN.

## Inspiration
 
### Appsus NFT Art Generator

I have been into NFT and Blockchain development and was thinking to build a NFT project. While there are a number of NFT generators available online, I thought I could improve on the current publicly available design. However, while starting my new generator project I found out the Appsus NFT Art Generator open source project had improved their generator in a lot of the similar ways I was hoping to improve. it now had a new great user interface and when compared to other generators, this generator could mint NFT with only a few clicks. I love how this website has a user-friendly interface so non-developers can approach their software easily. In the end I decided to pivot my project and I am still figuring out the next step.
 
### Three.js

With ongoing metaverse trends, I am always trying to keep up with the web design that can inspire more people. Often, I visit Awwwards.com to find inspiration on the latest trends when planning out any of my projects. A common theme stood out to me, a lot of websites are using three.js to make complicated 3D visuals. Looking at all the examples on the site, it is really hard not to want to dive into a project using three.js. My latest idea was to create a menu but using different floating objects in their own space. Each change of item selection would span the camera to a new ‘space’ and show a new 3D representation of that menu item. Stay tuned for this project. 

## Focus
 
Given six months with all the possible resources available, I would try to adapt to the company’s culture and learn new technologies that I’m not familiar. Getting to know the team I work with is very important. I want to work hard but at the same time communicate with my colleagues so I can be a team player.
